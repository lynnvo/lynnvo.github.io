	  	Hi! I'm Lynn Vo, and I like computers and people.
	  	<p> 
	  		I am an undergradudate student studying both cognitive and computer science at UCSD (University of California, San Diego). 
	  	<p> 
	  		Currently, I am a product manager at <a href = "http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>.</p>
	  	<p> 
	  		I believe in learning and exploring, both for the purpose of self improvement. I am interested in the balance between cognition and technology, and its role in enabling people to pursue their passions.
